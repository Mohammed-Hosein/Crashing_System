# Crashing_System
Crashing_System using arduino uno controller
 I build A RC car wit Arduino microcontroller, The RC car have a crash sensor and a GSM and GPS sender/reciever.
 When the crash happened the crash sensor will send a signal to the controller the controller will fetch the location from the GPS and send this information with the GSM to a pre-installed number in the programming or in a database the  number can be the emergency number or any number we like.
